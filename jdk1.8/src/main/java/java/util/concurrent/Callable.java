 * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.

 * instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 * {@code Runnable}, however, does not return a result and cannot
 * throw a checked exception.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class contains utility methods to
 * convert from other common forms to {@code Callable} classes.
